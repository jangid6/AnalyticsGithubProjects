# Business intelligence & Data-sceince Projects
Welcome to my analytics portfolio which contains projects developed over the time to tackle business problems to showcase my learning and industry-level implementaion.

A little about me:

Despite being a medicine student in highschool, I have done my graduation in Information Technology and in my 2nd year when everybody started mastering programming language C++/Java but I never felt that this is something where i want to grow my career TBH i never liked C++. So, I looked around and come to know about python.

I self-taught python language from scratch and started learning and practising OOPS and analytics skills.
